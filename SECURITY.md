## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

The CloudChat team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:

1. **Email**: [security@cloudchat.example.com] (replace with actual email)
2. **Private GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish?
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the application are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
- **Your Contact Information**: For follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: Every 7 days until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 90 days for critical issues, 180 days for others

### Security Best Practices

#### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Keep your browser updated
- Log out from shared devices
- Report suspicious activity

#### For Developers
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow Firebase security best practices
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement proper error handling

### Firebase Security

Our Firebase configuration follows security best practices:

```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules Example
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Messages are only accessible to authenticated users
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Group access is restricted to members
    match /groups/{groupId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
    }
  }
}
```

### Known Security Considerations

1. **Client-Side Security**: Remember that client-side code is visible to users
2. **Firebase Rules**: All security enforcement happens at the Firebase level
3. **Input Validation**: All user inputs should be validated and sanitized
4. **Authentication**: Proper authentication checks are implemented
5. **Data Privacy**: User data is protected according to privacy policies

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible
- Clearly marked in release notes
- Communicated through GitHub releases
- Backwards compatible when possible

### Hall of Fame

We maintain a hall of fame for security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities:

<!-- Will be updated as reports come in -->
- [Your name could be here!]

### Legal

By reporting a vulnerability, you agree that:
- You will not publicly disclose the issue until we've had a chance to address it
- You will not access user data beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- You will not perform testing that could harm our users or services
- You are acting in good faith to improve security
